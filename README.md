Tired of not being able to Transmog incomplete sets or the many dungeon/leveling sets not found in the default set list?  Better Wardrobe & Transmog was created to solve these issues and to improve the transmog experience without needing a host of additional addons installed.  It adds new features to the Collection Journal, Transmog Vendor, Dressing Room and tooltip pages.

Features:
General Improvements:

- Collection Alerts: Alerts are printed in the chat window if a set, extra set, or collection list appearance was learned.
 
Improved Collection Journal:

- Listings for Additional Transmog Sets: Adds listing to the Set Collections page for additional outfits. These include dungeon, questing, event sets and many more from the WoWhead transmog set databse. These sets display like the base sets with a listing of set completion for incomplete sets and a different highlight for completed sets. *Note that many of the recolor/lookalike sets appear to be missing pieces or wrong piece types, this is because many of the sets are are actually incomplete on there listing on WoWHead
- Saved Sets Tab: If a character has any custom saved sets a new tab will be show that lists them.
- Favorite Extra Sets: You can now set favorites in the extra sets list
- Visual View of the Collection Sets: By clicking the Eye icon in the Collection Sets menu, you can switch from a list view to a visual view of all the sets, similar to when at the transmog vendor.
-Tansmog Queue: You can now queue a set or extra set to be transmoged directly from the Collections Journal. This is done by right clicking on the set and selecting Queue Set. Then at the transmog vendor just click on the "Import/Export Options"button (Gear Icon) next to the save button and select "Load Set".  The queued set will be loaded to the paper doll for transmog.
- Improved Sorting: Collection Items and sets can now be sorted with the following options - Color*, Similar Appearances*, Expansion, Alpha. (*Color and appearances are sorted using the items appearance file name, which is not always exact in how it sorts. )
- Hide Item Appearances and Sets: Right clicking on an item will give you the option to hide it from view. These setting are hooked to a character based profile so you can quickly copy them among different characters or quickly reset the list. There is an toggle in the settings menu to have the UI show previously hidden items, which will have an icon indicating that they had been hidden.
- Collection List: You can select an appearance or a set to build up a list of appearances that you want to track. Once added to the list they can be easily viewed by clicking the "Collection List Book Icon" in the lower right corner of the Item Collection tab. Appearances in the Collection List have a small book icon and once the appearance is learned, a small check mark will be shown.
- "Shopping List": By <Shift> Clicking on the "Collection List Book Icon" a more detailed view of the Collection List is shown. This view displays all the items that unlock the selected appearance and info on how that item is obtained. If TradeSkillMaster is installed then the price for items are shown for Vendor, Profession and World Drop items when available. DBMarket is used as default, but additional TSM pricing can be set in the options.
- TSM Group Lists: From the "Shopping List" page you can generate a TSM group list that contains Vendor, Profession and World Drop items grouped by their appearance.
- Item Substitution:  Substitute the item shown in a set for another.  Just right click on the item in the set preview window or via the options page.  Great for when an item is no longer in game, or if you think another item will look better.
- View other armor weight sets:  See other types of armor by selecting it via the Filters Drop Down menu.  *This is currently only available on the Extra Tab, the functionality for the default sets is currently in development.
- View other class sets in the Extra Sets: Turn off the class filter in the options menu to see all armor for your classes armor type.  Armor sets flagged for other classes will show up with a visual indicator and they class added to it name.

 
Improved Transmog Vendor:

- Randomizer: Build a completely random set by clicking on the Randomizer button at the Transmog vendor. Alternatively you can have it randomly select a user saved outfit by <Shift> clicking the button. Currently there is no way to ignore slots or randomize a specific slot, but these features are on the list to add in a future release.
-Transmog Incomplete Sets: No more missing out on a outfit just because your are missing that one piece that never drops. Just set the max number of missing pieces allowed and any sets that match will be shown when visiting the Transmog vendor, additionally you can select slots to ignore when considering missing pieces. When at the Transmog vendor you can easily toggle between seeing the full set and the actual collected set pieces.
-"Combine Sets":  When at the transmog vendor you can combine multiple sets to fill in missing appearances. To use first select the initial appearance to use, then hold the <Shift> key and select any new set. The appearances from the second set will be used to fill in any missing pieces from the initial appearance. You can do this for as many sets until all appearance slots have been used. Great if you are missing a few pieces and want to fill them in with a similar appearance from a different raid type or with a lookalike set.
- Names & collected set piece count added to the transmog vendor view.
